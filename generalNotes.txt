(1.5) * Text I/O, regardless of where it originates or where it goes to,
        is dealt w/ as streams of characters.

        -----------
      * text stream: a sequence of characters divided into lines;
        -----------  each line consists of zero/more characters followed
                     by a '\n'.

      * ch = getchar() -> Reads the next input character from a text stream.

      * putchar(ch) -> Prints a character each time it's called.

      * EOF is an integer defined in <stdio.h>
        You can manually input EOF from the terminal by hitting CTRL-D.

(1.6) * The SWITCH statement is useful when writing a multi-way branch, and is
        particularly suitable when the condition is whether some integer or
        character expression matches one of a set of constants.
