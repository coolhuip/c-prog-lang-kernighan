(1.5) * Text I/O, regardless of where it originates or where it goes to,
        is dealt w/ as streams of characters.

        -----------
      * text stream: a sequence of characters divided into lines;
        -----------  each line consists of zero/more characters followed
                     by a '\n'.

      * ch = getchar() -> Reads the next input character from a text stream.

      * putchar(ch) -> Prints a character each time it's called.

      * EOF is an integer defined in <stdio.h>
        You can manually input EOF from the terminal by hitting CTRL-D.

(1.6) * The SWITCH statement is useful when writing a multi-way branch, and is
        particularly suitable when the condition is whether some integer or
        character expression matches one of a set of constants.
        (more on this in Section 3.4)

(1.7) * Function definitions can appear in any order, and in one source file
        or several.

      * main(): return(0) --> Normal termination of program
                return(--NON-ZERO--) --> Unusual OR erroneous termination conditions

(1.8) * In C, ALL function arguments are passed "by value".
            -> The called function is given the values of its arguments in
               TEMPORARY variables rather than the originals.
                   -> Argument values are locally copied, NOT referenced.

      * It's possible to make a function modify an argument in a collaing routine.
        Two conditions must be met:
            1. Caller must provide the ADDRESS of the variable to be set
            2. Callee must declare the parameter to be a pointer & access the
               variable indirectly through it.
        (more on this in Chapter 5)

      * When the name of an array is used as argument, the value passed to the
        function is the location or address of the first element of the array.
            -> There is NO COPYING of array elements.
